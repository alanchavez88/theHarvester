The harvester is a tool originally coded by Christian Martoerlla from Edge Security. This is not the original repo. The original repo lives in google code and you can get to it here:

https://code.google.com/p/theharvester/

I forked my own version theHarvester from google code because I needed to update the codebase so that it work within my environment, and adding new features.

What is this?
-------------

theHarvester is a tool for gathering e-mail accounts, subdomain names, virtual hosts, open ports/ banners, and employee names from different public sources (search engines, pgp key servers). 

Is a really simple tool, but very effective for the early stages of a penetration test or just to know the visibility of your company in the Internet.

The actual sources are:

Passive:
--------
-google: google search engine  - www.google.com

-google-profiles: google search engine, specific search for Google profiles

-bing: microsoft search engine  - www.bing.com

-bingapi: microsoft search engine, through the API (you need to add your Key in the discovery/bingsearch.py file)

-pgp: pgp key server - pgp.rediris.es 

-linkedin: google search engine, specific search for Linkedin users

-shodan: Shodan Computer search engine, will search for ports and banner of the discovered hosts  (http://www.shodanhq.com/)

-vhost: Bing virtual hosts search

Active:
-------
-DNS brute force: this plugin will run a dictionary brute force enumeration
-DNS reverse lookup: reverse lookup of ip´s discovered in order to find hostnames
-DNS TDL expansion: TLD dictionary brute force enumeration


Dependencies:
------------
none

Changelog 3:
---------------
-Updated code to use python 3 instead of python 2
-Removed original banner because when running the harvester in bulk it takes too much space in my terminal
-Updated the google-profiles query to look specifically for Google+ profiles
-Removed the customsearch endpoint, as this route has already been deprecated by Google and hitting it returns a 404 response
-Removed jigsaw from the list of providers as jigsaw is now data.com and it requires an API to use this provider. The endpoint was no longer working. 
Changelog 2.2a:
---------------
-Fixed Linkedin parser (thanks Alton Johnson and Francesco Stillavato)
-New banner with superpowers

Changelogin 2.2:
----------------
-Added Jigsaw (www.jigsaw.com)
-Added 123People (www.123people.com)
-Added limit to google searches as the maximum results we can obtain is 1000
-Removed SET, as service was discontinued by Google
-Fixed parser to remove wrong results like emails starting with @


Changelog in 2.1:
----------------
-DNS Bruteforcer
-DNS Reverse lookups
-DNS TDL Expansion
-SHODAN DB integration
-HTML report
-DNS server selection 


Changelog in 2.0:
----------------
-Complete rewrite, more modular and easy to maintain
-New sources (Exalead, Google-Profiles, Bing-Api)
-Time delay between request, to prevent search engines from blocking our IP´s
-You can start the search from the results page that you want, hence you can *resume* a search 
-Export to xml
-All search engines harvesting
